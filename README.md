# React Scratch

This is a basic react boilerplate with minimal package installations. The project includes hot-reload and LESS. 

To get started:

1. Clone or download the repo.
2. cd into the repo and run `npm i`.
3. Once dependencies have been installed, run `npm start` and view your project on `http://localhost:3000/`.
4. To build, run `npm build`.

Enjoy!
