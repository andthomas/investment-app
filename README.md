# Investment App Concept

A concept app for a fintech investment service. Built off a my own (react boilerplate)[https://github.com/andthomas/react-scratch] and using react router and Grommet UI.

To get started:

1. Clone or download the repo.
2. cd into the repo and run `npm i`.
3. Once dependencies have been installed, run `npm start` and view your project on `http://localhost:3000/`.
4. To build, run `npm build`.

Enjoy!
