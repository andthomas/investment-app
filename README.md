# Investment PWA Concept

A concept progressive web app for a fintech investment service. Built off a my own [react boilerplate](https://github.com/andthomas/react-scratch) and using react router and Grommet UI.

At this point in time, I have built the login screen and am working on the dashboard:

To get started:

1. Clone or download the repo.
2. cd into the repo and run `npm i`.
3. Once dependencies have been installed, run `npm start` and view your project on `http://localhost:3000/`.
4. To build, run `npm build`.

Enjoy!
